# NSChecker

The NSChecker is a semantic veriﬁcation system to ﬁnd inconsistencies among policies deﬁned in NS-Req (NS-Pol) and global policies previously created in the NFVI (NFVI-Pol). 

NSChecker has three primary functions. First, it enables the operator or NFV-MANO to record both NFVI physical and virtualresourcesaswellastheirpolicies(NFVI-Pols),working as an NFVI-RR. Second, it enables the NFV-MANO to record all instantiated NSs, working as an NFV-IR. Finally, once an NS-Req is received, NSChecker enables NFV-MANO to record policies extracted from NSD and perform the detection and diagnosis of conﬂicts between NS-Pols and NFVI-Pols.
